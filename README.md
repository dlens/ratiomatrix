# Ratio Matrix paper and sample calculations
This repository has a simple paper on the ratio matrix calculation and how it gives back the original priority vector.
In addition some python code is provided for calculating the largest eigenvector and ratio matrix, and some
examples are shown in a Jupyter notebook.

* [PrioritiesToMatrix.pdf](PrioritiesToMatrix.pdf): The mathematical paper describing the methodology.
* [SampleCalculations.ipynb](https://github.com/dlmaths/ratiomatrix/blob/master/SampleCalculations.ipynb): The Jupyter notebook with sample calculations, including a largest eigenvector calculation.

## Jupyter / Python
The above sample code uses [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) with python code.  

* Please see [installing Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) for information about getting started with Jupyter. 
* See the section of that document titled [Installing Jupyter using Anaconda and conda](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#id3) for the easiest method of getting started with Jupyter.
